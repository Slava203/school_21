## Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to train a program to guess the price of a car given its kilometrage. It's a simple linear regression problem.

## How to use ?

Be sure to have a Python > 3.5 installed, with numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

### If the model has already been trained

```sh
# predict all data from file
python3 predict.py
```
To predict a price:

```sh
python3 predict_value.py
```

### To train the dataset:

```sh
python3 train.py
```
